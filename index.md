Experience
<hr>
    Dragon Hacks 2018
    
        Worked on a project that used an Amazon Alexa, a 
        Raspberry Pie and a camera to create a doorbell system
        that integrates Facebook’s API to use facial 
        recognition to ID the guest. I learned how to use 
        Raspbian as well as AWS.
        
    Software intern at Realty USA
        
        Worked with one of the head programmers to learn one
        of the company’s databases, how it worked and how it
        was updated. Eventually started updating the database 
        on my own. Also spent a lot of time just watching the
        head programmer work while he walked me through his 
        thought processes.
